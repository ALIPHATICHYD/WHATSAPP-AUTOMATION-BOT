##### This is a simple NodeJS program to automate sending and replying to whatsapp messages using *node-cron*,*qrcode-terminal* and *whatsapp-web* NPM packages. I hope to implement scheduled job-postings using Puppeteer. Buckle up for that ðŸ˜‰

#### My motivation behind this project:
Over the long period of time I've been using whatsapp (3+ Years), there were moments when I forgot
to send messages such as birthday messages or messages requesting permission from someone and I thought: I've been coding since 2019, why don't I just *automate* it? Here we are ðŸ˜…

#### How to Install and run:
*Disclaimer: This was made with Node.js v18.12.1*
- Clone the repository
- Run these commands in the terminal: `npm i` and then `npm run start`
- You're all set

#### Using the project:
When you authenticate for the first time, you are required to login by scanning the QR code using *Whatsapp* installed on your phone.
***Note*: This is the default configuration, you can check out more authentication methods with the *whatsapp-web.js* package at [Whatsapp-Web website]('https://wwebjs.dev/guide/')**

After the first authentication, a folder named '.wwebjs_auth' will be created in the pwd, which will store session information. Basically, you only have to login *once*.

By default, while the program is running, it sends the message `Hello, this is a scheduled message(position *int*)!` every 30 minutes. This was done using with the help of *node-cron* package,
